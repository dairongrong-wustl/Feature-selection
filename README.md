## Finding genes that are critical for developing Alzheimer’s disease
1. Applied Random Forest and SVM models to identify critical genes whose aberrant regulation may lead to Alzheimer’s disease using a real dataset of more than 8000 genes of 176 patients of Alzheimer’s disease and 188 age-matched normal people (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929709001086); 
2. Used Association Rule method to identify and remove redundant features;
